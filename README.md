* Activity Registration ASP.NET Core Web App *
  
This project is an ASP.NET Core web application designed to manage activity registrations. It's currently being developed.
It allows users to:
Browse and search for available activities and classes.
View detailed information about each offering (e.g., description, instructor, schedule, fees).
Register for activities.
Manage their existing registrations (e.g., view details, cancel registrations).
Sign up for the waitlist for each activity when the capacity is reached.
